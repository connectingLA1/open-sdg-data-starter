It is designed to give the public access to information in the possession of public agencies. The Act also provides that public records shall be open for inspection during regular office hours of the agency. The public can inspect or receive a copy of any record unless the record is exempted from disclosure under the act.\nWho can initiate a Public Records request? Anyone may initiate a request for public records.\nThe California Public Records Act requires an Agency to provide a response to the public records request within 10 calendar days. \nPublic Record requests from the Office of the City Clerk may include a wide variety of documents and other materials (including print, photographic, and electronic formats) that were created or obtained by the department and are, at the time the request is filed, in the department's possession and control.

In 1954, Congress codified earlier census acts and all other statutes authorizing the decennial census as [Title 13, U.S. Code](https://www.census.gov/history/www/reference/privacy_confidentiality/title_13_us_code.html). Title 13, U.S. Code, does not specify which subjects or questions are to be included in the decennial census. The next Census will be conducted nationwide in the year 2020.\n\nIn additional to the decennial census, the [American Community Survey (ACS)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/about.html) is an ongoing survey that provides vital information on a yearly basis about our nation and its people. Information from the survey generates data that help determine how more than $675 billion in federal and state funds are distributed each year.\n\nThe United States has achieved [100% birth and death registration](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/).\n"},"17-3-1":{"indicator":"17.3.1","layout":"indicator","permalink":"/17-3-1/","sdg_goal":"17","data_non_statistical":true,"goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-17-03-01.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United
